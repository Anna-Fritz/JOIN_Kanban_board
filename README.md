# JOIN - Kanban Board

## ‚ú® Project Description

JOIN is a task management tool that visualizes the status and responsibilities of tasks. It allows creating, editing, and organizing tasks with the following features:

- Scheduling, prioritization, and status management
- Assignment of users and subtasks
- Drag & drop for status changes
- Contact management (add, edit, delete)
- Overview page with task statistics and deadlines
- User authentication with a custom backend
- Guest login for quick testing of the web app

JOIN was developed using HTML, CSS & Vanilla JavaScript. Originally, it was a group project during a training program at Developer Akademie and used Firebase as a backend. It has since been forked and migrated to a custom SQL-based backend with  REST APIs.
